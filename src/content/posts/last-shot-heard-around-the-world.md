The privileged part of that statement is, like many Americans, my day wasn't impacted by the most effective killing force in history doing what it does best. I took my kids to a college baseball game with my friend Will and his children. Two dads, six kids, a few beers, a cloudless sky, and America's pastime. While the prospect of a new war hung in the back of my mind, it had a hard time finding space in a picturesque afternoon. And I'll be damned if my kids caught a whiff of it.

After the game (i.e., the third inning), six kids wanted milkshakes, so we walked to the burger joint that is on the way home. I mentioned this morning's attacks in Iran to Will and described the tension of having a carefree day despite them. I told him that I'm glad the kids were protected from it, but I'm bummed they inherit it.

He agreed and commented that we still get to set their reality. I casually interpreted it as keeping them blissfully ignorant, but he followed up.

"You know the shot heard around the world? What if there's a *last* shot heard around the world that happens while we're in charge."

God, help us if there's a chance. And especially if there isn't.
