This is not a current events blog, but I keep tripping over our country's seeming disregard for human life and our propensity for "removing" world leaders, regardless of who is on the receiving end.

The privileged part is that, like many Americans, my day wasn't impacted by the most effective killing force in history doing what it does best. I took my kids to a college baseball game with my friend Will and his children. Two dads, six kids, a few beers, a cloudless sky, and America's pastime. While the prospect of a new war hung in the back of my mind, it had a hard time finding space in a picturesque afternoon. And I'll be damned if my kids caught a whiff of it.

After the game (i.e., the third inning), six kids wanted milkshakes, so we walked to the burger joint on the way home. I mentioned this morning's attacks in Iran to Will and tried to name the tension of having a carefree day despite them. I told him I'm glad the kids were protected from it, but I'm bummed they inherit it.

He agreed and said we still get to set their reality. I took that to mean keeping them blissfully ignorant, but he followed up.

"You know the shot heard around the world? What if there's a *last* shot heard around the world that happens while we're in charge."

God, help us if there's a chance. And especially if there isn't.
